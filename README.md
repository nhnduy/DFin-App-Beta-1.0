# DFin-App-Beta-1.0
Last update: December 30, 2022 <br />
The application is developed (in Python) for users to access financial information, which includes the closing prices of individual stocks on the market and two indicators of the Macroeconomics in the U.S: Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Unemployment Rate. <br /> <br />
Users can see visualization on the app by graphs and can export data (csv file) to the local folder. Because of the time constraint to develop this application, this version 1.0 will have limited features. <br /> <br />
[Project Description](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18r86FgpYEx1TauRBwVlr_s1-8HV70h74/view)<br /><br />
To use: Download the source code at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e_72vYTBIinM9C8_EwP-D5pAQl3950Do/view) <br />
Import modules needed (Check the comments in the code). If the code does not work properly, make sure you have the latest yfinance library module installed. To update the latest version: pip install yfinance --upgrade <br />
It may take 5-10 seconds to open the app. <br /><br />
I took down the executable file because yfinance library actively releases new version to work with Yahoo Finance's API. So, it's easier to run the Python file and keep updating it. <br />

Thank you for reading.
