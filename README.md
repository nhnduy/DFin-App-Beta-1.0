# DFin-App-Beta-1.0
The application is developed (in Python) for users to access financial information, which includes the closing prices of individual stocks on the market and two indicators of the Macroeconomics in the U.S: Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Unemployment Rate. <br /> <br />
Users can see visualization on the app by graphs and can export data (csv file) to the local folder. Because of the time constraint to develop this application, this version 1.0 will have limited features. <br /> <br />

To use: Download the rar file at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mTYtyi5IX521eI1wBiMz4iey-uExffp2/view <br />
Extract the rar file, open the "DFin App Beta 1.0.exe" in the folder dist. It may take 5-10 seconds to open the app. <br />

Thank you.
